Step 1 was getting the data needed for us to clean up, thiss data was provided by the owner
from calendly. After getting the data we created a project folder to hold the csv's, I then
created randomizer.py to protect the clients PII. The owner gave us permission to keep their
information in the csv's

Step 2 was creating the code to parse through the folder that was holding the data and then transform the data based on the information from the client and writing the code to upload the clients information to google drive/ google sheets.

Step 3 in the project was creating a program for recurring projects. The business is a local business and I was asked to do the rest until the end of the year!
