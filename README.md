Calendly Data Pipeline for Client Invoicing
Objective: Built an ETL pipeline to automate data extraction, anonymization, and reporting for a local dog training business using Python and Google Sheets.

Step 1: Data Extraction and Anonymization
Extracted appointment data from the client's Calendly account and stored it in CSV files within a structured project folder. Developed a Python script, randomizer.py, to anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) while retaining the integrity of the dataset. Client consent was obtained to store non-sensitive data for internal processing.

Step 2: Data Transformation and Upload
Utilized Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, CSV) to parse and clean the extracted data. Transformed it into a structured format suitable for invoicing and reporting. Implemented Google’s API to automate the upload of the transformed CSV files directly to the client’s Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts, enabling real-time access and collaboration.

Step 3: Recurring Process Automation
Created a program to automate the recurring data extraction, transformation, and upload process for future projects. This allowed the business to manage invoicing and reporting efficiently until the end of the year without manual intervention.
